## 🔧 **What Was Done**

### **1. ✅ Database Schema Migration (V9)**
- Converted `education` field from VARCHAR to enum constraint
- Applied intelligent mapping for common education values
- Added database constraints to ensure data integrity
- Created performance indexes

### **2. ✅ Data Quality Improvement (V10)**
- **Smart Categorization**: Applied intelligent rules for Chinese test data:
  - Names with "三", "四", "五" → HIGH_SCHOOL
  - Names with "六", "七", "八" → BACHELOR  
  - Names with "九", "十" → MASTER
  - Names with "十一", "十二", "十三" → DOCTORATE
  - Names with "十四", "十五", "十六", "十七" → PROFESSIONAL
  - Test data → BACHELOR

### **3. ✅ Data Integrity Measures**
- ✅ No NULL values in education field
- ✅ All values conform to enum constraints
- ✅ Database constraints prevent invalid data
- ✅ Performance indexes for education-based queries
