Now I need to add log in feature for the project.

- Sales can login with phone number and password
- provide register functionality for the sales to provide phone number and password, password should be input twice when register
- phone number should be unique
- please hardcode the amdin user with phone number 18980994001 and password 123456

After the log in feature is done, I need to modify the exsiting create customer functionality.
- When create a customer, each customer should have a sales person related, can use the sales phone number as the key identifier
- eash sales person can only view and modify the customers created by himeself/herself
- the admin user can see and modify all the customers
