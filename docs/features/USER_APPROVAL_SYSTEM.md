# User Approval System

> **Admin-controlled user registration with approval workflow for enhanced security and user management**

## üìã **Overview**

The User Approval System adds an administrative layer to the user registration process, ensuring that only approved users can access the Customer Tracker CRM system. This feature enhances security and gives administrators full control over who can access the system.

## üéØ **Business Requirements**

### **Core Functionality**
- **Admin Approval Required** - All new user registrations must be approved by an admin before login access is granted
- **Approval Dashboard** - Dedicated admin interface to view and manage pending registration requests
- **Action Tracking** - Complete audit trail of approval/rejection decisions with timestamps and reasons
- **Status Management** - Clear status indicators for pending, approved, and rejected registrations

### **User Experience**
- **Registration Flow** - New users can still register but receive a "pending approval" message
- **Login Restrictions** - Unapproved users cannot login and receive appropriate error messages  
- **Admin Notifications** - Admins are notified of new registration requests
- **Bulk Operations** - Admins can approve/reject multiple requests simultaneously

    participant Admin as Admin User
    participant Database as Database

    NewUser->>Frontend: Fill registration form
    Frontend->>Backend: POST /auth/register
    Backend->>Database: Save user with status "PENDING"
    Backend-->>Frontend: Registration successful, pending approval
    Frontend-->>NewUser: "Registration submitted, awaiting admin approval"
    
    Note over Admin: Admin logs in and checks dashboard
    Admin->>Frontend: View pending approvals
    Frontend->>Backend: GET /admin/user-approvals
    Backend->>Database: Fetch pending users
    Backend-->>Frontend: List of pending users
    Frontend-->>Admin: Display approval dashboard
    
    Admin->>Frontend: Approve/Reject user
    Frontend->>Backend: POST /admin/user-approvals/{id}/approve
    Backend->>Database: Update user status to "APPROVED"
    Backend-->>Frontend: Approval successful
    Frontend-->>Admin: Success notification
    
    Note over NewUser: User attempts to login
    NewUser->>Frontend: Login attempt
    Frontend->>Backend: POST /auth/login
    Backend->>Database: Check user status
    Backend-->>Frontend: Login successful (if approved)
    Frontend-->>NewUser: Access granted to CRM
```

## üìä **User Status Lifecycle**

## üîß **Technical Specifications**

### **Database Schema Changes**

#### **Sales Table Updates**
```sql
-- Add approval status and related fields to existing sales table
ALTER TABLE sales ADD COLUMN approval_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'PENDING';
ALTER TABLE sales ADD COLUMN approved_by_phone VARCHAR(20);
ALTER TABLE sales ADD COLUMN approved_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
ALTER TABLE sales ADD COLUMN rejection_reason TEXT;
ALTER TABLE sales ADD COLUMN status_updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;

-- Add constraint for valid approval statuses
ALTER TABLE sales ADD CONSTRAINT check_approval_status 
CHECK (approval_status IN ('PENDING', 'APPROVED', 'REJECTED'));

-- Add foreign key for approver
ALTER TABLE sales ADD CONSTRAINT fk_sales_approver 
FOREIGN KEY (approved_by_phone) REFERENCES sales(phone);

-- Create index for efficient approval queries
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_approval_status ON sales(approval_status, created_at);
```

#### **User Approval History Table**
```sql
-- Track approval/rejection history
CREATE TABLE user_approval_history (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_phone VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    action VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- 'APPROVED', 'REJECTED', 'RESET'
    admin_phone VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    reason TEXT,
    action_timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    
    CONSTRAINT fk_approval_history_user FOREIGN KEY (user_phone) REFERENCES sales(phone),
    CONSTRAINT fk_approval_history_admin FOREIGN KEY (admin_phone) REFERENCES sales(phone),
    CONSTRAINT check_approval_action CHECK (action IN ('APPROVED', 'REJECTED', 'RESET'))
);

CREATE INDEX idx_user_approval_history_user ON user_approval_history(user_phone, action_timestamp DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_approval_history_admin ON user_approval_history(admin_phone, action_timestamp DESC);
```

## üé™ **User Experience Flow**

### **New User Registration**
1. User fills out registration form
2. System validates input and creates account with `PENDING` status
3. Success page displays: *"Registration successful! Your account is pending admin approval. You will be notified once approved."*
4. User cannot login until approved

### **Admin Approval Process**
1. Admin logs into system
2. Dashboard shows notification of pending approvals
3. Admin navigates to "User Approvals" section
4. Reviews pending registrations with user details
5. Approves or rejects with optional reason
6. System updates user status and records action

### **User Login Experience**
- **Pending**: *"Your account is pending approval. Please contact admin."*
- **Rejected**: *"Access denied. Contact admin for more information."*
- **Approved**: Normal login proceeds

## üìà **Metrics & Analytics**
