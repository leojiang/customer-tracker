#Project development instructions


###Branch strategy
- each new feature should be developed on a feature branch
- feature branch naming convention is 'feature/feature_name'


### Development guide
- Everytime finish coding, ask me to confirm whether need to commit the code. Because I may have more stuff to add.
- Code style should follow google java standard for backend  and ESlint standard for frontend.
- For each UI component, the wordings should be translated to all supported language.


### Code commit & push policy
- Before commit, check code style and other checks, if failed, need to remind me to modify and commit again
- before push code, run unit tests to make sure all cases passed, if failed, need to fix
