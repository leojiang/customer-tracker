Project development instructions


Branch strategy
### each new feature should be developed on a feature branch
### feature branch naming convention is 'feature/feature_name'


Development guide
### Everytime finish coding, ask me to confirm whether need to commit the code. Because I may have more stuff to add.
### Code style should follow google java standard for backend  and ESlint standard for frontend.
### For each UI component, the wordings should be translated to all supported language.




Code commit & push policy
### Before commit, check code style and other checks, if failed, need to remind me to modify and commit again
### before push code, run unit tests to make sure all cases passed, if failed, need to fix
